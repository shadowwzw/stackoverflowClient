(if you're lucky)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Granted, it is much harder to do with a reference - but if you manage it, you'll tear your hair out trying to find it. References are <em>not</em> inherently safe in C++!</p>\n\n<p>Technically this is an <strong>invalid reference</strong>, not a null reference.  C++ doesn't support null references as a concept as you might find in other languages.  There are other kinds of invalid references as well. <em>Any</em> invalid reference raises the spectre of <strong>undefined behavior</strong>, just as using an invalid pointer would.</p>\n\n<p>The actual error is in the dereferencing of the NULL pointer, prior to the assignment to a reference.  But I'm not aware of any compilers that will generate any errors on that condition - the error propagates to a point further along in the code. That's what makes this problem so insidious. Most of the time, if you dereference a NULL pointer, you crash right at that spot and it doesn't take much debugging to figure it out.</p>\n\n<p>My example above is short and contrived. Here's a more real-world example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyClass\n{\n    ...\n    virtual void DoSomething(int,int,int,int,int);\n};\n\nvoid Foo(const MyClass &amp; bar)\n{\n    ...\n    bar.DoSomething(i1,i2,i3,i4,i5);  // crash occurs here due to memory access violation - obvious why?\n}\n\nMyClass * GetInstance()\n{\n    if (somecondition)\n        return NULL;\n    ...\n}\n\nMyClass * p = GetInstance();\nFoo(*p);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to reiterate that the only way to get a null reference is through malformed code, and once you have it you're getting undefined behavior. It <strong>never</strong> makes sense to check for a null reference; for example you can try <code>if(&amp;bar==NULL)...</code> but the compiler might optimize the statement out of existence! A valid reference can never be NULL so from the compiler's view the comparison is always false, and it is free to eliminate the <code>if</code> clause as dead code - this is the essence of undefined behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The proper way to stay out of trouble is to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer to create a reference. Here's an automated way to accomplish this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;\nT&amp; deref(T* p)\n{\n    if (p == NULL)\n        throw std::invalid_argument(std::string(\"NULL reference\"));\n    return *p;\n}\n\nMyClass * p = GetInstance();\nFoo(deref(p));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For an older look at this problem from someone with better writing skills, see <a href=\"http://www.gotw.ca/conv/002.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Null References</a> from Jim Hyslop and Herb Sutter.</p>\n\n<p>For another example of the dangers of dereferencing a null pointer see <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20171222-00/?p=97635\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exposing undefined behavior when trying to port code to another platform</a> by Raymond Chen.</p>\n"

Since template parameters are duck-typed, syntactic properties of a type is all that matters, so often the same template can be used with both <code>T</code> and <code>T&amp;</code>.<br>\n(or <code>std::reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</code> which still relies on an implicit cast\nto <code>T&amp;</code>)<br>\nTemplates that cover both <code>T&amp;</code> and <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> are even more common.   </p></li>\n<li><p><em>Lvalues</em>. Consider the statement <code>str[0] = 'X';</code> Without references it would only work for c-strings (<code>char* str</code>). Returning the character by reference allows user-defined classes to have the same notation.  </p></li>\n<li><p><em>Copy constructors</em>. Syntactically it makes sense to pass objects to copy constructors, and not pointers to objects. But there is just no way for a copy constructor to take an object by value - it would result in a recursive call to the same copy constructor. This leaves references as the only option here.  </p></li>\n<li><p><em>Operator overloads</em>. With references it is possible to introduce indirection to an operator call - say, <code>operator+(const T&amp; a, const T&amp; b)</code> while retaining the same infix notation. This also works for regular overloaded functions.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These points empower a considerable part of C++ and the standard library so this is quite a major property of references.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>The difference is that non-constant pointer variable(not to be confused with a pointer to constant) may be changed at some time during program execution, requires pointer semantics to be used(&amp;,*) operators, while references can be set upon initialization only(that's why you can set them in constructor initializer list only, but not somehow else) and use ordinary value accessing semantics.  Basically references were introduced to allow support for operators overloading as I had read in some very old book. As somebody stated in this thread - pointer can be set to 0 or whatever value you want. 0(NULL, nullptr) means that the pointer is initialized with nothing. It is an error to dereference null pointer. But actually the pointer may contain a value that doesn't point to some correct memory location. References in their turn try not to allow a user to initialize a reference to something that cannot be referenced due to the fact that you always provide rvalue of correct type to it. Although there are a lot of ways to make reference variable be initialized to a wrong memory location - it is better for you not to dig this deep into details. On machine level both pointer and reference work uniformly - via pointers. Let's say in essential references are syntactic sugar. rvalue references are different to this - they are naturally stack/heap objects.</p>\n"

They can be used like normal variables. â€˜&amp;â€™ operator is needed only at the time of declaration. Also, members of an object reference can be accessed with dot operator (â€˜.â€™), unlike pointers where arrow operator (->) is needed to access members.</p>\n\n<p><em>Together with the above reasons, there are few places like copy constructor argument where pointer cannot be used.

      "body": "<p>References are very similar to pointers, but they are specifically crafted to be helpful to optimizing compilers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>References are designed such that it is substantially easier for the compiler to trace which reference aliases which variables. Two major features are very important: no \"reference arithmetic\" and no reassigning of references. These allow the compiler to figure out which references alias which variables at compile time.</li>\n<li>References are allowed to refer to variables which do not have memory addresses, such as those the compiler chooses to put into registers. If you take the address of a local variable, it is very hard for the compiler to put it in a register.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void maybeModify(int&amp; x); // may modify x in some way\n\nvoid hurtTheCompilersOptimizer(short size, int array[])\n{\n    // This function is designed to do something particularly troublesome\n    // for optimizers. It will constantly call maybeModify on array[0] while\n    // adding array[1] to array[2]..array[size-1]. There's no real reason to\n    // do this, other than to demonstrate the power of references.\n    for (int i = 2; i &lt; (int)size; i++) {\n        maybeModify(array[0]);\n        array[i] += array[1];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>An optimizing compiler may realize that we are accessing a[0] and a[1] quite a bunch. It would love to optimize the algorithm to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void hurtTheCompilersOptimizer(short size, int array[])\n{\n    // Do the same thing as above, but instead of accessing array[1]\n    // all the time, access it once and store the result in a register,\n    // which is much faster to do arithmetic with.\n    register int a0 = a[0];\n    register int a1 = a[1]; // access a[1] once\n    for (int i = 2; i &lt; (int)size; i++) {\n        maybeModify(a0); // Give maybeModify a reference to a register\n        array[i] += a1;  // Use the saved register value over and over\n    }\n    a[0] = a0; // Store the modified a[0] back into the array\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To make such an optimization, it needs to prove that nothing can change array[1] during the call. This is rather easy to do. i is never less than 2, so array[i] can never refer to array[1]. maybeModify() is given a0 as a reference (aliasing array[0]). Because there is no \"reference\" arithmetic, the compiler just has to prove that maybeModify never gets the address of x, and it has proven that nothing changes array[1].</p>\n\n<p>It also has to prove that there are no ways a future call could read/write a[0] while we have a temporary register copy of it in a0. This is often trivial to prove, because in many cases it is obvious that the reference is never stored in a permanent structure like a class instance.</p>\n\n<p>Now do the same thing with pointers</p>\n\n<pre><code>void maybeModify(int* x); // May modify x in some way\n\nvoid hurtTheCompilersOptimizer(short size, int array[])\n{\n    // Same operation, only now with pointers, making the\n    // optimization trickier.\n    for (int i = 2; i &lt; (int)size; i++) {\n        maybeModify(&amp;(array[0]));\n        array[i] += array[1];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The behavior is the same; only now it is much harder to prove that maybeModify does not ever modify array[1], because we already gave it a pointer; the cat is out of the bag. Now it has to do the much more difficult proof: a static analysis of maybeModify to prove it never writes to &amp;x + 1. It also has to prove that it never saves off a pointer that can refer to array[0], which is just as tricky.</p>\n\n<p>Modern compilers are getting better and better at static analysis, but it is always nice to help them out and use references.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, barring such clever optimizations, compilers will indeed turn references into pointers when needed.</p>\n"

Your computer may use an address to make them work, but you're not supposed to worry about that: you're supposed to think of them as \"just another name\" for an existing object and the syntax reflects that. They are stricter than pointers so your compiler can more reliably warn you when you about to create a dangling reference, than when you are about to create a dangling pointer.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, there are of course some practical differences between pointers and references.

At least with gcc\n    // Now lets try to print it's value!\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; str_ref &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    // It works! Now lets print and compare actual memory addresses\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; str_ptr &lt;&lt; \" : \" &lt;&lt; &amp;str_ref &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    // Exactly the same, now remember to free the memory on the heap\n    delete str_ptr;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which outputs this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>THIS IS A STRING\n0xbb2070 : 0xbb2070\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you notice even the memory addresses are exactly the same, meaning the reference is successfully pointing to a variable on the heap! Now if you really want to get freaky, this also works:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    // In the actual new declaration let immediately de-reference and assign it to the reference\n    std::string &amp;str_ref = *(new std::string(\"THIS IS A STRING\"));\n    // Once again, it works! (at least in gcc)\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; str_ref;\n    // Once again it prints fine, however we have no pointer to the heap allocation, right? So how do we free the space we just ignorantly created?\n    delete &amp;str_ref;\n    /*And, it works, because we are taking the memory address that the reference is\n    storing, and deleting it, which is all a pointer is doing, just we have to specify\n    the address with '&amp;' whereas a pointer does that implicitly, this is sort of like\n    calling delete &amp;(*str_ptr); (which also compiles and runs fine).*/\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which outputs this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>THIS IS A STRING\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Therefore a reference IS a pointer under the hood, they both are just storing a memory address, where the address is pointing to is irrelevant, what do you think would happen if I called std::cout &lt;&lt; str_ref; AFTER calling delete &amp;str_ref? Well, obviously it compiles fine, but causes a segmentation fault at runtime because it's no longer pointing at a valid variable, we essentially have a broken reference that still exists (until it falls out of scope), but is useless.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, a reference is nothing but a pointer that has the pointer mechanics abstracted away, making it safer and easier to use (no accidental pointer math, no mixing up '.' and '->', etc.), assuming you don't try any nonsense like my examples above ;)</p>\n\n<p>Now <strong>regardless</strong> of how a compiler handles references, it will <strong>always</strong> have some kind of pointer under the hood, because a reference <strong>must</strong> refer to a specific variable at a specific memory address for it to work as expected, there is no getting around this (hence the term 'reference').</p>\n\n<p>The only major rule that's important to remember with references is that they must be defined at the time of declaration (with the exception of a reference in a header, in that case it must be defined in the constructor, after the object it's contained in is constructed it's too late to define it).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remember, my examples above are just that, examples demonstrating what a reference is, you would never want to use a reference in those ways! For proper usage of a reference there are plenty of answers on here already that hit the nail on the head</strong></p>\n"
